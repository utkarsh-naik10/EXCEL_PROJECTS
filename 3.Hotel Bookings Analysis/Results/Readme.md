### 3️⃣ Behavior & Segmentation
- **Dominant Market Segment:** Online Travel Agents (OTAs)  
- **Highest Cancellation Channel:** TA/TO (Travel Agent/Tour Operator)  
- **Lead Time Impact:** Longer lead times correlate with higher cancellation risk  
- **Customer Type:** Transient customers record the highest ADR ($107)
